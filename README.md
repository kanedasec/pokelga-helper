# PokeLGA Helper

A session tracker for **Pokemon Let's Go Adventure** — a tabletop board game played with physical cards and dice. Tracks each player's Pokemon team, items, badges, board position, and Victory Points in real time.

Built for a group of up to 6 players. One admin account manages the game session; players log in to manage their own boards.

---

## Features

- **Dashboard** — live overview of all players: team, badges, PP bar, board position, events, notes
- **Board view** — interactive map with draggable player tokens and auto-detection of board areas
- **Card viewer** — browse all decks (Green, Blue, Red, Mega, Legendary, Item, Event) with card images
- **Victory Points** — live VP table with full breakdown per player
- **Admin panel** — create/manage players, start/end/restart games, view past game results
- **Auto-refresh** — dashboard polls every 15 seconds

## Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Backend | FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + SQLite |
| Auth | JWT (python-jose) + bcrypt |
| Frontend | Vanilla JS, no framework |
| Container | Docker + Docker Compose |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions → SSH → EC2 |

---

## Running locally

```bash
# Copy and fill in your admin password
cp docker-compose.yml docker-compose.yml   # already has dev defaults

docker compose up --build
```

App available at `http://localhost:8000`
API docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`

Default dev credentials (set in `docker-compose.yml`):
- Username: `admin`
- Password: set by `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `SECRET_KEY` | Yes | JWT signing secret — use a random 32+ char string in production |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Yes | Password for the `admin` account — app refuses to start without it |
| `DATABASE_URL` | No | SQLite path (default: `sqlite:////app/data/game.db`) |
| `ENVIRONMENT` | No | `development` or `production` |

## Game lifecycle

```
setup  →  active  →  ended
  ↑                     |
  └─────────────────────┘  (restart resets player data, increments game number)
```

- **setup**: admin creates player accounts, players can log in but game isn't running
- **active**: game in progress, all features enabled
- **ended**: game over, results snapshot saved, visible in admin panel

---

## Deployment

Automated via GitHub Actions on push to `main`. See `DEPLOY.md` for full AWS EC2 setup instructions (excluded from git — infrastructure details stay local).

Two GitHub secrets are required: `EC2_HOST` and `EC2_SSH_KEY`.

## Security notes

- Rate limiting on login: 10 attempts/minute per IP
- All DB queries use SQLAlchemy ORM (no raw SQL with user input)
- User-supplied content is HTML-escaped before DOM insertion
- Ownership enforced on all resource endpoints (users can only modify their own data)
- Admin-only endpoints protected by `get_admin_user` dependency
- `.env.prod` with secrets lives only on the server, never committed
